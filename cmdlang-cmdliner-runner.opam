description: """\

[Cmdlang_cmdliner_runner] is a library for running command line
programs specified with [cmdlang].

It provides a standard way to run cmdlang commands, assuming you are
using [pp-log] modules such as [Pp_tty] and [Err]. It is opinionated
and adds a few dependencies to your project, such as [Logs] and [Fmt].
